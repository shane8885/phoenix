TODO:
- need to remove vote button for owner of event, only attendees can vote and this causes an exception
- enforce selection and vote deadlines
- validate start and deadline dates for events
- add event search to index page
- maybe I should just add the event owner as a unconfirmed attendee by default?
- event page should preview selections then link to browse seperately (multiple paginations on 1 page is messy)
