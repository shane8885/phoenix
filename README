== Project Phoenix

This is a project to write a website used for creating and running private movie nights or movie festivals. It may already exist somewhere but I don't really care since I want to do it my way and learn a few things on the way.  It uses the The Movie Database (www.themoviedb.org) for movie information and then allows users to create events, make movie selections, invite other users to attend and vote on selections and finally schedule the event and individual sessions. And a few other features along the way. 

This project is largely an excerses for me to learn Ruby on Rails programming but I'd also love to see the site become a useful product, esspecially since I myself love running movie festivals with my friends.

Not much point putting any more info here just yet since it's very early days and everything is in development... I'll update this down the track when things are taking shape.
