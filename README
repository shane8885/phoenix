== Project Phoenix

This is a web app for running a social movie club. It's aimed at small groups of friends rather than large professional festivals.

A user can create an event and invite other users to attend, once invited a user can start choosing films they want to see included in the event (the app hooks into  TMDB for movie info). An event could be a single night or span across many months. While selecting films users can also vote for other selections. The owner of the event then makes the official selections (based on votes or other factors) and schedules movie sessions.

Along the way the web app will update users periodically on things like deadlines, new selections, upcoming sessions, new reviews etc.

This is still a work in progress or though the app does have a lot of the functionality in place.
